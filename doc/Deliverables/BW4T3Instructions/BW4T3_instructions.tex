\section{Introduction}
Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.

This document describes how to install Blocks World For Teams (BW4T) for use with GOAL. We briefly comment where necessary how it would work with a different agent system. You can also use BT4T stand-alone but this is not described in this document. BW4T is a client-server system. The server is responsible for the administration, simulation and visualization of the virtual world: it keeps track of robots, rooms, blocks, connected GOAL agents, etc. The server uses Repast, software to simulate virtual environments, to do part of this administration. The client is GOAL, which runs a multi-agent system (MAS) and connects to the server. The agents in the GOAL client get percepts from the server, and send actions to the server. Client and server can run on a different computer. This document describes how to install the BW4T server, configure it, place the BW4T client in GOAL, configure the MAS file, and run the system.

This chapter descibes how users can install and use the Blocks World for Teams environment. For developer information please go to the project page on github  https://github.com/eishub/BW4T and click on the Link to Developer Details.

We use the following names to refer to directories of BW4T:
\begin{itemize}
\item $<$GOAL$>$ refers to the directory where you installed GOAL.
\item $<$SERVER$>$ refers to the directory where you have put the server.jar, documentation and utilities.
\item $<$CLIENT$>$ refers to the directory where you have put the client.jar.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System requirements}
To use BW4T you need Java JDK 7 or higher. The BW4T3 environment has been tested on Windows 7, Windows 8 and OSX. Note that OSX may come with java 6 pre-installed. You need to install java 7. You can then keep java 6 installed as well, but ensure that java 7 is used as the default.

\subsection{Installation}
You need to install a number of items to run BW4T from GOAL. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item (if not yet done): Install Java 7 and made it the default Java (such that double clicking on a jar makes it open with Java 7).
 \item You can download GOAL from $http://ii.tudelft.nl/trac/goal$. You can choose for the plugin for Eclipse or the stand-alone SimpleIDE.
 \item GOAL provides a sample Multi-agent-system 'BW4T3' that is demonstrating the Blocks World for Teams system. \footnote{If you run in a different agent system, you can download the client-side environment from $https://github.com/eishub/BW4T/releases$. Select $bw4t-client-X.Y.Z.jar$. This is the environment that should be attached to your agent system. You then will have to write your own agents that can run in the BW4T world.}
 \item You can download the BW4T server from $https://github.com/eishub/BW4T/releases$ and save it in $<$SERVER$>$. Select the latest $bw4t-server-X.Y.Z.jar$.
 \item You can optionally download the BW4T map editor from $https://github.com/eishub/BW4T/releases$ and save it in $<$SERVER$>$. Select the latest $bw4t-environment-store-X.Y.Z.jar$.
 \item You can optionally download the BW4T scenario editor from $https://github.com/eishub/BW4T/releases$ and save it in $<$SERVER$>$. Select the latest $bw4t-scenario-editor-X.Y.Z.jar$.
\end{enumerate}
  

\section{Running the server}
Run the server before running the client, as otherwise the client cannot connect to the server. Start the server by opening (typically: double clicking) the server.jar in $<$SERVER$>$. This should open the server window (Figure 1). Note that during this opening, two other maps are created: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Maps: The folder in which all possible maps are put.
\item Log: The folder in which all log files will be placed.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{server.png}
    \caption{Server window}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Advanced run settings}
The default settings for the server can be changed in the command line of your OS. To change the server ip and/or server port execute the following:\\

java -jar bw4t-server.jar -servip $<$server ip here$>$ (default: localhost) -serverport $<$serverport here$>$ (default: 8000)\\

If you change the serverip and/or serverport, change the client settings correspondingly (see below).
The server will now start using the new values.

\section{Running the client (Human Controlled Bot)}
Before running the client, make sure you have already started the server. Start the client.jar in $<$CLIENT$>$. Figure 2 will show up and the bot is automatically added to the server. You can now control the bot by clicking (left or right) at different spots in the Client.
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{client.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Client window}
\end{wrapfigure}

\section{Running the client (Agent Controlled Bot)}
Before running the client, make sure you have already started the server. Start Eclipse IDE and load your GOAL files. Open the .mas2g file and press the run button. This time, no new window will appear. The agent will control your bot and all evaluations will be shown in the console. In the server window you will see your bot(s) move according to the rules applied in the .goal file(s).

\subsection{Advanced run settings}
The following MAS init parameters are available (the default values are shown inside the brackets). In GOAL these settings can be changed from the mas2g file. Most of  these parameters are not needed if you use an agent config xml file. The CONFIGFILE option is needed if you use a config file. The HUMANGUI option is needed if you have a human GUI connected with an agent (and the agent should receive percepts as well). 

\begin{itemize}
\item

    CLIENTIP("localhost"):    client's own IP. Passed to server so server is able to find us with this IP. 

\item
    CLIENTPORT("2000"):   The port that the client listens to. 


\item
    SERVERIP("localhost"):
 The IP address of the server. 
  
\item
    SERVERPORT("8000"):
   The Port that the server listens on. 

\item
    AGENTCOUNT("0"):
 the amount of agents (also specified in the launchpolicy section, see below), that the client should load. If the agentcount is higher than the amount of entities in the map then they won't be loaded. (default: 0).. 
    
\item
    LAUNCHGUI("true"):
    whether to launch a separate GUI for each bot (controlled by an agent or human) can be set to true or false. This GUI shows the environment from the perspective of the bot. (default:false).


\item
    HUMANCOUNT("1"):
    the amount of human players that should be loaded. If the humancount is higher than the amount of entities in the map then they won't be loaded. 

\item
    AGENTCLASS("nl.tudelft.bw4t.client.agent.BW4TAgent"):
    The java agent class to load when new entities appear.
   

\item
    GOAL("true"):
    are we connected with GOAL? This param should be auto detected, it will be set to false if the program is started from commandline.

\item
    KILL(""):
  The key we should try to use to kill the remote server.
 
\item
    CONFIGFILE(""):
    The file from which the client reads the configuration.
 
\item
    GOALHUMAN("false"):
    Forces the use of the human GUI with an GOAL agent to translate the commands. You should turn on this option if you have a human GUI but still want the agent to receive the percepts.

\item
    MAP(""):
    The map name to be loaded. If you specify a map, the server will reset to load the new map, which disconnects all entities.
     
\item    
    LOG("ERROR"):
    The log4j log level to be used. Available values: OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFODEBUG and ALL.

\end{itemize}

The number of agents is specified at two places in the mas2g file. First, the agentcount and humancount specify the number of entities of the corresponding type that should be created in the environment. Second, the launchpolicy specifies which and how many agents should be connected to these entities. Make sure that the agentcount and humancount in the initialization parameters are in line with the launch policy section in the mas2g file. Furthermore, the number of agents should not exceed the maximum number of agents defined on the map (see section “Loading and creating new maps” below).
If you use BW4T from a batch runner, you may want to reset the server after each run. This is done by specifying a map in the mas file init parameters.

\section{Restarting, pausing and resuming the system}
If you are running from SimpleIDE, you can pause and resume the system at any time by clicking the pause or step buttons. When running from Eclipse, to be able to pause the system, don't run the mas2g file as described above.
This time, open the mas2g file and click on the debug button (the small bug icon).
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{debug.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Choose yes}
\end{wrapfigure}
Eclipse will ask you whether you would like to go to the debug screen (see figure 3), click yes and watch your screen adjust.
Now you can see the running bots listed at the left side, and the current goals, beliefs and knowledge of the selected bot on the right side. Beneath the list the goal file belonging to the bot is shown and at the bottom of the screen, all debug actions are being run. See figure 4.
To pause the system, select the bot to be paused and click on the pause button. To resume, select the bot and click resume.
To restart the system, do the following
\begin{enumerate}
\item In eclipse, kill the MAS by clicking the red box (stop button) at the right of the console window.
\item In the server window, press Reset, or choose a new map from the Change Map menu.
\item Run the MAS in Eclipse as described above.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{debugmode.png}
    \caption{Debug mode}
\end{figure}

\section{Using the interface}
To use the interface, the user clicks with the left (occasionally the right) mouse button in the GUI. Depending on where the user clicks, different menus appear. The user then picks the appropriate action from the menu to execute that action. Below the possibilities are explained.
\subsection{Sending messages}
By clicking on the dropdown menu, the user can choose to which bot he or she will send a request or question. “all” sends the message to all bots. Next to the dropdown menu, a button is placed with choose message. This button contains the messages that are most likely to be sent. Left clicking this button will create a list from which the user can choose a message. When clicking in the “Bot Chat Session”, gives a number of standard answers: yes, no, don't know, ok, etc. It is not possible to use free text because the non-human agents can only process these pre-specified messages. The specification document gives more details on how messages are processed by non-human agents.
\subsection{Click on room or dropzone}
By clicking on a room, the user can order his bot to go to that room, tell everybody something about that room or ask something about that room.
\subsection{Click on blocks}
By clicking on a block (particularly, those below the drop zone), the user can tell everybody something about that block, or ask others for information about that block.
\subsection{Click on hallway}
By clicking on a hallway, the user can point to an exact (X,Y) location to go to. Also it is possible to tell all others roughly where one is in the hallway.

\section{Running on multiple computers}
If you want to run BW4T on multiple computers you should designate one of these computer as the server. On this computer you can start the server as described in the first section of this guide. You must use RMI messaging (check the GOAL Run menu) to allow other GOAL runtimes to connect .
You need to check a few things in the MAS that you use here:
\begin{itemize}
\item specify a map such that the environment resets when you start up the MAS
\item make sure that the map that is used has enough entities to accommodate all agents in all computers that want to connect
\item make sure that the entities get the proper type, by specifying the proper agentcount and humancount.
\end{itemize}
The other computers will then function as client. Create a MAS file for each of these, and configure this MAS as follows (see also bw4thuman.mas2g in the GOALagents directory of GOAL):
\begin{itemize}
\item set the serverip and serverport initialization parameters to the ones that the server is listening on (default for the server is localhost and port 8000).
\item Set the humancount and agentcount parameter on each client to reflect how many human or agent players that client should load.
\item Use humanbot.goal for human agents
\item use env = $<$CLIENT$>/$client.jar". in the environment section. Do not connect to an already running environment in another MAS. This is because BW4TClient creates GUIs for humanbots, on the machine where it is running.
\item Check that the launchpolicy picks up the proper entity type, so use 'human' if you want to attach to human entities etc.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Distributed human GUIs}
This section describes how to run a set of distributed human GUIs such that they all communicate through GOAL. Before running a set of distributed Human GUIs with Eclipse, make sure that the server is installed on one machine. Furthermore, make sure that the server map can contain a sufficient number of entities.
To run a set of distributed Human GUIs with GOAL, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start the server
\item For each machine where you want to have a human GUI:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Start  Eclipse IDE
    \item Open the MAS file of the bw4thuman.mas2g
    \item adjust the serverip to correctly point to the machine ip number where the server runs
    \item Start the MAS
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Programming a BW4T Agent}
To program your own BW4T agent, use the same actions as specified in the demorobot. You can  choose to change the pre- and post conditions of each action.

Percepts are retrieved automatically by GOAL, see the percept specifications for what percepts you can expect.

In order for messages received by other GOAL agents to appear on the GUI of your agent, you should add the following lines to your GOAL agent’s code:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add the following line to your knowledge base:\\
\#import “messageTranslation”.
\item Add the following line at the end of your goal file. \\
\#import “message.mod2g”.
\item Add the following line to the start of your event module: \\
if bel(true) then message. \\
This will make sure that the message module that was just imported will be run first when entering the event module.
\item Your own message handling code should be performed after this line and should delete any messages after handling them. Otherwise they will be continuously posted to the GUI as they are not deleted by the message module. If you don’t do any message handling yet you can add the following line below the one provided in step 3 to delete all received messages: \\
forall bel(received(Agt,Msg)) do delete(received(Agt,Msg)).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Testing your agent}
In order to test your agent you should edit the bw4t.mas2g file as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Add your agent to the agentfiles list.
\item Add a line to the launchpolicy (copy the line of the demorobot and replace 'demorobot' with the name of your agent).
\end{itemize}
Make sure that you set GOAL to launch the desired number of your agent. Also make sure that the initialization parameter of agentcount is not set to 0 as then only humanbots will be loaded.

Note that besides in the bw4t.mas2g file, the number of agents is also specified in the map that you use. This number determines the maximum amount of bots that can appear on the map. If the maximum number of agents to be launched as specified in the bw4t.mas2g file is bigger than the number of agents specified in the map, some of the agents will not appear on the map and not be part of the team. 

\section{Creating your own Scenario}
This part describes how to make use of the Scenario Editor (Figure 7). When you open the editor, you see two main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Configuration panel, which is used to create, open and save configuration files.
\item The Entity panel, where a list of bots and a list of e-partners are being displayed. Here you can create, modify, rename and delete bots and e-partners.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{editor.png}
\caption{Scenario Editor}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{General use}
At the top of the editor you can see a $File$ menu. If you click on that, you get the options to create a new configuration,open a configuration, save your configuration, export your configuration and to exit the editor.

On the left side of the editor you can configure a scenario as you like. The Client IP, the Client Port, the Server IP and the Server Port should already contain the default values. You can change them if you need to. You can also indicate whether you want to open a GUI, visualise the paths the bots take or enable collisions. If you have a map file you want to use, you can import it by selecting the $Open$ $file$ button at the right section.

On the right side of the editor you can create, modify, rename and delete bots and e-partners. There also are a list of bots and a list of e-partners that are created, and below each list there is an indication of how many bots or e-partners are created in total.

Linked to the Scenario Editor are the Bot Store and the E-partner Store, which will also be discussed in this document.

\section{Log file}
Repast logs the following for each run into a file. The filename is “BW4TXXXX.log” where XXX is the date and time to make the filename unique. The file is saved in the $<$SERVER$>/$log directory. It contains:
\begin{enumerate}
\item sequence: goal sequence (which block colors are to be dropped)
\item room: initial blocks per room
\item action: log of each action of a bot, with timestamp 
\item total time: total time to complete task. Begin time is determined by first incoming action. End time is determined by the last block of the sequence dropped.
\item agentsummary: for each agent:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the bot type containing its handicaps
    \item \# correct drops in dropzone
    \item \# incorrect drops in dropzone
    \item total time of standing still
    \item \# messages to other agents
    \item \# rooms entered
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Logs are written to the file as soon as possible, so that information won't get lost when the system is being killed before the end of the sequence is reached.
