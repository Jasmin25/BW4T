#Blocks World for Teams - v3.5.0
Blocks World for Teams (**BW4T**) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.
