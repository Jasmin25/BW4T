\chapter*{Abstract}

In this Context Project we have taken the original Blocks World For Teams (BW4T) software and developed a new version that is more maintainable, more extensive in its features set, and easier to use. We have restructured the original code and added different capabilities, including additions that allow the user to interact with the system in various ways. The result is that the software can simulate a wider range of real world problems.
