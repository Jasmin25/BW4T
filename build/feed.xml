    <title>Blocks World for Teams</title>
    <description>Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.[http://goo.gl/PVAk0c]</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the BW4T Repository. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a550537.pdf&quot;&gt;[AFRL-AFOSR-UK-TR-2011-0046]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maven Dependency Repository is currently located under the website root in the &lt;code&gt;./repo/&lt;/code&gt; directory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this website the BW4T-Team will post guides and small articles regarding the development of BW4T.&lt;/p&gt;
