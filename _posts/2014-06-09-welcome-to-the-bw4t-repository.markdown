Welcome to the BW4T Repository. 

Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particular order as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.

The Maven Dependency Repository is currently located under the website root in the `./repo/` directory. 

On this website the BW4T-Team will post guides and small articles regarding the development of BW4T.
